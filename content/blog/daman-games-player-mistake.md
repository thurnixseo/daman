## Part 1: What Exactly is "Chasing Losses"?

"Chasing losses" is a term for a destructive cycle of behavior. It starts with an unexpected loss, which triggers a feeling of frustration or panic. Instead of sticking to their strategy, the player immediately places a much larger, often reckless, bet in a desperate attempt to win back the money they just lost in a single round.

**Here's a classic example:**
1.  A player starts with a strategy of betting ₹20 per round.
2.  They lose the first bet. Feeling annoyed, they decide to "win it back."
3.  For the next round, they abandon their strategy and bet ₹50. They lose again.
4.  Now in a panic, having lost ₹70, they bet ₹150 on the next round, thinking, "This one has to be a winner!"

This vicious cycle is driven by emotion, not logic, and it's the fastest way to deplete your entire bankroll.

## Part 2: The Psychology Behind the Mistake

Why is this trap so effective on new players? It's rooted in basic human psychology.

* **Loss Aversion**: Scientific studies show that the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. We are hardwired to want to undo a loss immediately, which leads to irrational decisions.
* **The Gambler's Fallacy**: This is the mistaken belief that if something happens more frequently than normal during a given period, it will happen less frequently in the future. For example, "I've lost five times in a row, so I'm definitely due for a win now!" In reality, each round on **Daman Games** is an independent event, and past results don't influence the next outcome.
* **Lack of a Plan**: Most new players jump in without a clear plan for how to handle losses. When a loss inevitably occurs, they don't have rules to fall back on, so emotion takes over.

## Part 3: How to Avoid This Mistake - The 3 Golden Rules

Avoiding this trap is simple, but it requires discipline. By setting firm rules for yourself *before* you start playing, you can protect yourself from emotional decisions.

### Golden Rule #1: Set a Strict Daily Loss Limit
This is the most critical rule. Before you place a single bet, decide the absolute maximum amount of money you are willing to lose for that day. This amount should be a sum you are completely comfortable with losing.
* **How to implement it**: If your daily loss limit is ₹300, the moment your balance drops by that amount, you **stop playing for the day**. No exceptions. Log out of the app. This single rule acts as a foolproof firebreak, preventing catastrophic losses.

### Golden Rule #2: Follow the 1-3% Bankroll Rule
To make losses feel insignificant, never bet a large portion of your capital on one outcome. A professional approach is to only risk 1% to 3% of your total **Daman Games** wallet on a single bet.
* **How it works**: If you have ₹2,000 in your account, your bets should be no more than ₹20 to ₹60. If you lose a ₹20 bet, the emotional impact is tiny, and the urge to "chase" it disappears. This keeps you in the game longer and allows your strategy to work.

### Golden Rule #3: Use a "Cool-Down" Period
If you find yourself on a losing streak (e.g., 3-4 losses in a row), the worst thing you can do is continue betting immediately. Your judgment is likely clouded.
* **The Strategy**: Implement a mandatory "cool-down" period. After three consecutive losses, log out of the app for at least 10 minutes. Go for a short walk, get a glass of water, or do something else to reset your mindset. This breaks the emotional momentum and allows you to return with a clear head.

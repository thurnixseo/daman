### 1. Our Commitment

Daman Game is committed to providing a safe, fair, and responsible gaming environment. We want all our players to enjoy our games as a form of entertainment, and we recognize that for a small minority, gaming can cease to be fun and become a problem. This policy is designed to help you stay in control of your gaming and to provide support if you need it.

Your well-being is our highest priority.

### 2. Maintaining Control

Gaming should be a planned and budgeted recreational activity, not a source of income or a way to escape problems. Here are some tips to help you play responsibly:

* **Play for fun, not to make money.** Treat any wins as a bonus, not an expectation.
* **Only gamble with money you can afford to lose.** Never use money set aside for essential expenses like rent, bills, or food.
* **Set money and time limits before you play.** Decide on a loss limit and stick to it. Take regular breaks.
* **Never chase your losses.** Trying to win back money you've lost often leads to bigger losses.
* **Balance gaming with other activities.** Don't let gaming take over your life and neglect your family, friends, or other hobbies.
* **Avoid playing when you are stressed, upset, or under the influence of alcohol.** Clear judgment is essential for responsible gaming.

### 3. Identifying a Potential Problem

If you are concerned about your gaming habits, ask yourself the following questions:

* Do you spend more time or money on gaming than you intend to?
* Have you ever lied to cover up the extent of your gaming?
* Have you neglected your work, studies, or family responsibilities because of gaming?
* Do you borrow money or sell possessions to fund your gaming?
* Do you feel restless, irritable, or anxious when you try to stop or cut down on gaming?
* Do you try to chase losses after a losing session?
* Do you use gaming as a way to escape from worry or problems?

If you answered "yes" to several of these questions, it may be a sign that you are developing a gaming problem. We strongly encourage you to seek help.

### 4. Player Protection Tools We Offer

To empower you to play responsibly, we offer a range of tools that can be accessed directly from your account settings or by contacting our support team.

* **Deposit Limits:** You can set daily, weekly, or monthly limits on the amount of money you can deposit into your account. This helps you manage your spending effectively.
* **Cool-Off Period (Time-Out):** If you feel you need a short break, you can activate a cool-off period for 24 hours, 7 days, or 30 days. During this time, you will not be able to log in or play.
* **Self-Exclusion:** For those who need a longer break, we offer a self-exclusion option. You can choose to exclude yourself from our Service for a period of 6 months, 1 year, 5 years, or permanently. During the self-exclusion period, your account will be closed, and you will not be able to open any new accounts.

### 5. Preventing Underage Gaming

It is illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to open an account or to play on Daman Game. We take our responsibility in this area very seriously and perform age verification checks on our customers. Any account found to be used by a minor will be immediately closed, and any winnings will be forfeited.

We encourage parents to use filtering software (such as Net Nanny or CyberPatrol) to prevent minors from accessing online gaming materials.

### 6. Seeking Professional Help

If you believe you may have a gambling problem, seeking professional help is the best step you can take. There are many free and confidential organizations dedicated to providing support and advice.

* **Gambling Therapy:** Offers free online support and counseling for anyone affected by problem gambling.

* **Gamblers Anonymous:** A fellowship of individuals who share their experience, strength, and hope with each other to solve their common problem and help others to recover from a gambling problem.
